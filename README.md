## AQI Monitoring and Prediction System

This project is a team-developed real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring system designed to collect, process, and analyze live air pollution and weather data for urban regions. The system focuses on building an automated, reliable data pipeline that operates without manual intervention.

Live data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API using Python-based automation and is structured for analysis and visualization. A machine learning model based on Linear Regression is used to predict short-term PM2.5 levels, while rule-based logic converts AQI values into meaningful health advisories.

The processed data is visualized using interactive dashboards built in Power BI, connected to a live data source. The project demonstrates effective teamwork, integration of data analytics and machine learning techniques, and practical use of cloud and business intelligence tools.
